## üåü Project Overview

Jarvis AI is an advanced personal assistant designed to provide a seamless, voice-activated interface for everyday tasks, information retrieval, and system automation. Inspired by sci-fi AI assistants, Jarvis aims to bring that futuristic experience to reality with a powerful, extensible architecture.

### Core Capabilities

- **Voice Interaction**: Natural speech recognition and text-to-speech using edge-tts
- **Real-time Information**: Web search capabilities with up-to-date information
- **System Automation**: Control applications and perform system tasks via voice commands
- **Conversational AI**: Context-aware responses using advanced language models
- **Graphical Interface**: Modern UI for visual interaction and feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

Jarvis AI is built with a modular architecture that separates frontend and backend components:

### Frontend
- **GUI Module**: PyQt5-based graphical interface
- **Status Management**: Real-time display of assistant and microphone status
- **Chat Display**: Visualization of conversation history

### Backend
- **Speech Recognition**: Convert spoken language to text
- **Text-to-Speech**: High-quality voice synthesis using edge-tts
- **Language Model**: Advanced NLP using Groq API
- **Decision Making**: First-layer decision module for command routing
- **Real-time Search**: Web search integration for up-to-date information
- **Automation**: System and application control capabilities

## üöÄ Future Vision

The current version of Jarvis AI represents the foundation for a much more ambitious project. Our roadmap includes transforming Jarvis from a monolithic AI assistant into a multi-agent system with advanced capabilities.

### Core Architectural Evolution

The next major version will shift to a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents work asynchronously under Jarvis's orchestration, improving scalability, performance, and the ability to handle complex tasks.

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Interruption Capability**: Allow users to interrupt Jarvis while it's speaking
2. **Futuristic GUI**: Redesign with sci-fi inspired holographic elements
3. **MCP Integration**: Enhanced reasoning and context management
4. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different tasks
5. **Archon.ai Integration**: Dynamic agent creation and management
6. **Sentiment Analysis and Emotional Intelligence**: Empathetic interactions based on user's emotional state
7. **Proactive Assistance**: Anticipate user needs before being explicitly asked
8. **Multimodal Understanding**: Process multiple input types simultaneously (voice, text, images, gestures)
9. **Adaptive Learning System**: Continuously learn from user interactions for personalization
10. **Contextual Memory Management**: Sophisticated memory system for coherent conversations
11. **Voice Persona Customization**: Adjustable personality and speaking style

## üíª Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sweden-technologies/Jarvis-AI-v1.0.git
cd Jarvis-AI-v1.0

# Install dependencies
pip install -r Requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file with the following variables:
# Username=YourName
# Assistantname=Jarvis
# GroqAPIKey=your_groq_api_key
# AssistantVoice=en-US-GuyNeural
# CohereAPIKey=your_cohere_api_key
# HuggingFaceAPIKey=your_huggingface_api_key

# Run Jarvis
python Main.py
```

## üîß Usage

Once running, Jarvis will listen for voice commands. You can:

- Ask general questions: "Jarvis, what is the capital of France?"
- Request real-time information: "Jarvis, what's the latest news about AI?"
- Control your system: "Jarvis, open Chrome" or "Jarvis, play music"
- Generate images: "Jarvis, generate an image of a futuristic city"

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See Requirements.txt for all dependencies

## üîÆ Detailed Future Roadmap

### Sentiment Analysis and Emotional Intelligence
Enhance Jarvis with the ability to detect and respond to the user's emotional state, creating more empathetic and contextually appropriate interactions through:
- Real-time sentiment analysis of user speech and text
- Emotion classification and adaptive responses
- Emotional memory to track patterns over time
- Voice tone adjustments based on emotional context

### Proactive Assistance
Enable Jarvis to anticipate user needs and provide information before being explicitly asked through:
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Contextual awareness of time, location, and calendar
- Predictive modeling using machine learning
- Privacy-focused design with user control

### Multimodal Understanding
Process multiple input types simultaneously for more natural interactions:
- Computer vision integration
- Multi-stream neural architecture
- Gesture recognition and image analysis
- Cross-modal reference resolution

### Adaptive Learning System
Continuously learn from user interactions to personalize responses:
- Secure interaction history database
- Reinforcement learning for optimization
- Preference tracking across domains
- Personalized language model fine-tuning

### Contextual Memory Management
Sophisticated memory system for coherent conversations:
- Hierarchical memory architecture
- Knowledge graph implementation
- Temporal awareness system
- Memory visualization tools

### Voice Persona Customization
Customizable personality and speaking style:
- Multiple pre-defined persona profiles
- Comprehensive personality parameter system
- Situation-aware persona switching
- Voice characteristic adjustments
